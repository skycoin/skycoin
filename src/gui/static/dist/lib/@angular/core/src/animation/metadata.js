/**
 * `animate` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's
 * animation
 * DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the
 * {@link Component#animations-anchor component animations metadata
 * page} to gain a better understanding of how animations in Angular2 are used.
 *
 * `animate` specifies an animation step that will apply the provided `styles` data for a given
 * amount of
 * time based on the provided `timing` expression value. Calls to `animate` are expected to be
 * used within {@link sequence an animation sequence}, {@link group group}, or {@link transition
 * transition}.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:
 *
 * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional
 * delay and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`
 * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,
 * delay=100, easing=ease-out`.
 * If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the `duration` value in millisecond
 * form.
 * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {@link style style} or {@link
 * keyframes keyframes}.
 * If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected and used (this is
 * useful when
 * describing an animation step that will complete an animation by {@link
 * transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // various functions for specifying timing data
 * animate(500, style(...))
 * animate("1s", style(...))
 * animate("100ms 0.5s", style(...))
 * animate("5s ease", style(...))
 * animate("5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)", style(...))
 *
 * // either style() of keyframes() can be used
 * animate(500, style({ background: "red" }))
 * animate(500, keyframes([
 *   style({ background: "blue" })),
 *   style({ background: "red" }))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))
 *
 * {@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}

 * page} to gain a better understanding of how animations in Angular2 are used.
 *
 * `group` specifies a list of animation steps that are all run in parallel. Grouped animations
 * are useful when a series of styles must be animated/closed off
 * at different statrting/ending times.
 *
 * The `group` function can either be used within a {@link sequence sequence} or a {@link transition
 * transition}
 * and it will only continue to the next instruction once all of the inner animation steps
 * have completed.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `steps` data that is passed into the `group` animation function can either consist
 * of {@link style style} or {@link animate animate} function calls. Each call to `style()` or
 * `animate()`
 * within a group will be executed instantly (use {@link keyframes keyframes} or a
 * {@link animate#usage animate() with a delay value} to offset styles to be applied at a later
 * time).
 *
 * ```typescript
 * group([
 *   animate("1s", { background: "black" }))

 * ])

 *
 * `sequence` Specifies a list of animation steps that are run one by one. (`sequence` is used
 * by default when an array is passed as animation data into {@link transition transition}.)
 *
 * The `sequence` function can either be used within a {@link group group} or a {@link transition

 * and it will only continue to the next instruction once each of the inner animation steps
 * have completed.
 *
 * To perform animation styling in parallel with other animation steps then
 * have a look at the {@link group group} animation function.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `steps` data that is passed into the `sequence` animation function can either consist
 * of {@link style style} or {@link animate animate} function calls. A call to `style()` will apply
 * the
 * provided styling data immediately while a call to `animate()` will apply its styling

 *
 * `style` declares a key/value object containing CSS properties/styles that can then
 * be used for {@link state animation states}, within an {@link sequence animation sequence}, or as
 * styling data for both {@link animate animate} and {@link keyframes keyframes}.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `style` takes in a key/value string map as data and expects one or more CSS property/value
 * pairs to be defined.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // string values are used for css properties
 * style({ background: "red", color: "blue" })
 *
 * // numerical (pixel) values are also supported
 * style({ width: 100, height: 0 })
 * ```
 *
 * #### Auto-styles (using `*`)
 *
 * When an asterix (`*`) character is used as a value then it will be detected from the element
 * being animated
 * and applied as animation data when the animation starts.
 *
 * This feature proves useful for a state depending on layout and/or environment factors; in such
 * cases
 * the styles are calculated just before the animation starts.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // the steps below will animate from 0 to the
 * // actual height of the element
 * style({ height: 0 }),
 * animate("1s", style({ height: "*" }))
 * ```

 * DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the

 * page} to gain a better understanding of how animations in Angular2 are used.
 *
 * `state` declares an animation state within the given trigger. When a state is
 * active within a component then its associated styles will persist on
 * the element that the trigger is attached to (even when the animation ends).
 *
 * To animate between states, have a look at the animation {@link transition transition}
 * DSL function. To register states to an animation trigger please have a look
 * at the {@link trigger trigger} function.
 *
 * #### The `void` state
 *
 * The `void` state value is a reserved word that angular uses to determine when the element is not
 * apart
 * of the application anymore (e.g. when an `ngIf` evaluates to false then the state of the
 * associated element
 * is void).
 *
 * #### The `*` (default) state
 *
 * The `*` state (when styled) is a fallback state that will be used if
 * the state that is being animated is not declared within the trigger.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `state` will declare an animation state with its associated styles
 * within the given trigger.
 *
 * - `stateNameExpr` can be one or more state names separated by commas.
 * - `styles` refers to the {@link style styling data} that will be persisted on the element once
 * the state
 * has been reached.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // "void" is a reserved name for a state and is used to represent
 * // the state in which an element is detached from from the application.
 * state("void", style({ height: 0 }))
 *
 * // user-defined states
 * state("closed", style({ height: 0 }))
 * state("open, visible", style({ height: "*" }))
 * ```
 *
 * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))

 *
 * `keyframes` specifies a collection of {@link style style} entries each optionally characterized
 * by an `offset` value.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `keyframes` animation function is designed to be used alongside the {@link animate animate}
 * animation function. Instead of applying animations from where they are
 * currently to their destination, keyframes can describe how each style entry is applied
 * and at what point within the animation arc (much like CSS Keyframe Animations do).
 *
 * For each `style()` entry an `offset` value can be set. Doing so allows to specifiy at
 * what percentage of the animate time the styles will be applied.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // the provided offset values describe when each backgroundColor value is applied.
 * animate("5s", keyframes([
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "red", offset: 0 }),
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "blue", offset: 0.2 }),
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "orange", offset: 0.3 }),
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "black", offset: 1 })
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, if there are no `offset` values used within the style entries then the offsets
 * will
 * be calculated automatically.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * animate("5s", keyframes([
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "red" }) // offset = 0
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "blue" }) // offset = 0.33
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "orange" }) // offset = 0.66
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "black" }) // offset = 1
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))
 *
 * {@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}

 * animation
 * DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the
 * {@link Component#animations-anchor component animations metadata
 * page} to gain a better understanding of how animations in Angular2 are used.
 *
 * `transition` declares the {@link sequence sequence of animation steps} that will be run when the
 * provided
 * `stateChangeExpr` value is satisfied. The `stateChangeExpr` consists of a `state1 => state2`
 * which consists
 * of two known states (use an asterix (`*`) to refer to a dynamic starting and/or ending state).
 *
 * Animation transitions are placed within an {@link trigger animation trigger}. For an transition
 * to animate to
 * a state value and persist its styles then one or more {@link state animation states} is expected
 * to be defined.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on
 * what the
 * previous state is and what the current state has become. In other words, if a transition is
 * defined that
 * matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be triggered.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger
 * trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the
 *   // animation has fully completed itself
 *   state("on", style({ background: "green" })),
 *   state("off", style({ background: "grey" })),
 *
 *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value
 *   // bound to "myAnimationTrigger" changes from "on" to "off"
 *   transition("on => off", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions
 *   transition("on <=> off", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas
 *   transition("on => off, off => void", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into
 *   // the page and the destination state is unknown
 *   transition("void => *", [
 *     style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *     animate(500)
 *   ]),
 *
 *   // this will capture a state change between any states
 *   transition("* => *", animate("1s 0s")),
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger`
 * animation trigger by binding to an element within its template code.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * #### The final `animate` call
 *
 * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only**
 * uses a timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final
 * animation
 * arc for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of
 * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the
 * applied state to be presented correctly.
 *
 * ```
 * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state
 * // is currently active for "myAnimationTrigger"
 * transition("void => *", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500)
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Transition Aliases (`:enter` and `:leave`)
 *
 * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common,
 * the `transition` function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which
 * are aliases for the `void => *` and `* => void` state changes.
 *
 * ```
 * transition(":enter", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 * ])
 * transition(":leave", [
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))
