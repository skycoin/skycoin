### Added

- New wallet frontend in angular4. This is a complete rewrite and fixes many
  of the old wallet issues.
- New wallet has preliminary support for OTC functionality
- Create `webrpc.Client` for JSON-2.0 RPC calls.
- Add this CHANGELOG.md file.
- Add Installation.md file, with install instructions for go.
- Timelock distribution addresses. The first 25% of the distribution is
  spendable. After that 25% is spent, a timestamp will be added to the code to
  enable further distribution.
- Add `/coinSupply` endpoint. Correctly returns total, locked and unlocked coin
  amounts.
- `testutil` package for common test setup methods.
- `/version` endpoint, which will return the current node version number and
  the HEAD commit id when build the node
- `-no-ping-log` option to disable ping/pong log output
- Check for invalid block signatures during startup and recreate the database
  if they are corrupted.
- Add methods for converting fixed-point decimal strings to droplets and
  vice versa.
- Add `make run`, `make test`, `make lint`, `make check` to `Makefile`

### Changed

- Flag peers as incoming or outgoing.
- Refactor to decouple `wallet` and `visor` package.
- Refactor `cli` package for use as a library.
- `README` improvements.
- Set default wallet's label as "Your Wallet"
- Use BIP32 mnemomic seeds by default in `address_gen`.
- Add `-x` option to `address_gen`, to generate a random base64-encoded 128-bit
  seed instead of a BIP32 mnemomic seed.
- Add `-v` option to `address_gen` to print all address information
  (pubkey, seckey, address, seed) to stdout as JSON.
- All API and CLI methods with "coin"-related arguments must be a string and
  can use decimal notation to specify coin amounts.
- CLI's `walletHistory` command prints amounts as fixed-point decimal strings.
  Previously, it printed amounts as integers representing whole skycoin amounts,
  and did not support droplets / fractional skycoins.
- A user is prevented from broadcasting a new transaction with unspent outputs
  that they have already sent as an unconfirmed transaction.

### Deprecated

- `/api/getEffectiveOutputs` is deprecated in favor of `/coinSupply`.
