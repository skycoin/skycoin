It is basicly GNU.

* free for non-commercial use, open source
* we wont sue you

Most of the libraries we have written are MIT license. Our crypto stack,
standards, devops, deployment and infrastructure is generally MIT license.

We have dual license for some parts of the code base to prevent abuse. We do
not want people forking coins a billion times however without permission (there
are some abuse edge cases we want to protect against). Some commercial
applications may require licensing or agreement. To stop destructive use or
abuse. So similar to Cryptonote and bctd in model.

We do a dual license for some corporate users, who need specialized
application, branding, extensions and support. For instance, we have corporate
client in China who wants a dropbox application and they want to use the
libraries and need extensions and branding. So we retain ownership rights so
that we can enforce the contract. While maintaining rights to open source parts
of the infrastructure built for the client (dual licensing).
