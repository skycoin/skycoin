 *
 * Note, adding try-finally block around the work to ensure that `wtfLeave` gets called can
 * negatively impact the performance of your application. For this reason we recommend that
 * you don't add them to ensure that `wtfLeave` gets called. In production `wtfLeave` is a noop and
 * so try-finally block has no value. When debugging perf issues, skipping `wtfLeave`, do to
 * exception, will produce incorrect trace, but presence of exception signifies logic error which
 * needs to be fixed before the app should be profiled. Add try-finally only when you expect that
 * an exception is expected during normal execution while profiling.
