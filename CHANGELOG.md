## [Unreleased]

### Added

- #896, Add CSRF check to wallet api
- #800, Add entropy parameter to `/wallet/newSeed` endpoint
- #877, Add -disable-wallet-api CLI option
- Add `total_coinhour_supply` and `current_coinhour_supply` to `/coinSupply` endpoint
- Remove `/logs` and log buffering due to possible crash
- Add `Host` header check to localhost HTTP interfaces to prevent DNS rebinding attacks
- #866, Include coins and hours in `/explorer/address` inputs

## [0.21.1] - 2017-12-14

### Fixed

- Fix blank page issue in windows gui wallet, which was caused by misusing the flag of -download-peers-list in electron.


## [0.21.0] - 2017-12-10

### Added

- Require transactions to have an input with non-zero coinhours
- Add `-peerlist-size` and `-max-outgoing-connections` CLI options
- Add `-download-peerlist` and `-peerlist-url` CLI options, to get peers from a URL
- For electron clients, download a list of peers from https://downloads.skycoin.net/blockchain/peers.txt by default

### Fixed

- Fix change hours calculation. Previous gave 1/8 to change and destination addresses; now gives 1/4 to each
- #653, the peerlist size was too small and could be easily filled up; default changed to 65535 from 1000

### Changed

- CLI's `walletBalance` and `addressBalance` commands return aggregate balances for confirmed, spendable and expected balances.  Coins are formatted as droplet strings.  Hours added as strings.
- When splitting an odd number of hours in a spend, give the extra hour to the fee
- Add `block_seq` to `get_outputs` and `/outputs` API response
- Improve UxOut spend selection. Previously, they were spent oldest first. Now they are spent to ensure a non-zero coinhour input and otherwise minimize coinhours.
- `create_rawtx` will try to minimize the number of UxOuts used to create a transaction.
- `/wallet/spend` will try to maximize the number of UxOuts used to create a transaction.
- Update the default peerlist size to 65535 from 1000
- When loading a wallet, 100 addresses will be scanned ahead to find one with a balance

## [0.20.4] - 2017-11-22

### Added

- Add  /logs api to filter skycoin logs ,so that we can add a debug panel to the GUI wallet to show logs

## [0.20.3] - 2017-10-23

### Fixed

- Fix block sync stall (mostly affected Windows users, but any OS was potentially affected)

## [0.20.2] - 2017-10-12

### Fixed

## [0.20.1] - 2017-10-12

### Fixed

## [0.20.0] - 2017-10-10

### Added

- New wallet frontend in angular4. This is a complete rewrite and fixes many
  of the old wallet issues.
- New wallet has preliminary support for OTC functionality
- Create `webrpc.Client` for JSON-2.0 RPC calls.
- Add this CHANGELOG.md file.
- Add Installation.md file, with install instructions for go.
- Timelock distribution addresses. The first 25% of the distribution is
  spendable. After that 25% is spent, a timestamp will be added to the code to
  enable further distribution.
- Add `/coinSupply` endpoint. Correctly returns total, locked and unlocked coin
  amounts.
- `testutil` package for common test setup methods.
- `/version` endpoint, which will return the current node version number and
  the HEAD commit id when build the node
- `-no-ping-log` option to disable ping/pong log output
- Check for invalid block signatures during startup and recreate the database
  if they are corrupted.
- Add methods for converting fixed-point decimal strings to droplets and
  vice versa.
- Add `make run`, `make test`, `make lint`, `make check` to `Makefile`

### Changed

- Flag peers as incoming or outgoing.
- Refactor to decouple `wallet` and `visor` package.
- Refactor `cli` package for use as a library.
- `README` improvements.
- Set default wallet's label as "Your Wallet"
- Use BIP32 mnemomic seeds by default in `address_gen`.
- Add `-x` option to `address_gen`, to generate a random base64-encoded 128-bit
  seed instead of a BIP32 mnemomic seed.
- Add `-v` option to `address_gen` to print all address information
  (pubkey, seckey, address, seed) to stdout as JSON.
- All API and CLI methods with "coin"-related arguments must be a string and
  can use decimal notation to specify coin amounts.
- CLI's `walletHistory` command prints amounts as fixed-point decimal strings.
  Previously, it printed amounts as integers representing whole skycoin amounts,
  and did not support droplets / fractional skycoins.
- A user is prevented from broadcasting a new transaction with unspent outputs
  that they have already sent as an unconfirmed transaction.

### Deprecated

- `/api/getEffectiveOutputs` is deprecated in favor of `/coinSupply`.

### Removed

- Old wallet
- `/api/create-address` endpoint (use the `address_gen` tool)

  confirmed.
