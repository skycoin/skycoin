Skycoin is a next-generation cryptocurrency.

Skycoin was written from scratch and designed over four years to realize the
ideal of Bitcoin and represents the apex of cryptocurrency design.
Skycoin is not designed to add features to Bitcoin,
but rather improves Bitcoin by increasing simplicity,
security and stripping out everything non-essential.

Some people have hyped the Skycoin Project as leading into "Bitcoin 3.0".
The coin itself is not "Bitcoin 3.0",
but is rather "Bitcoin 1.0". Bitcoin is a prototype crypto-coin.
Skycoin was designed to be what Bitcoin would look like if it were built from
scratch, to remedy the rough edges in the Bitcoin design.

- no duplicate coin-base outputs
- enforced checks for hash collisions
- simple deterministic wallets
- no transaction malleability
- no signature malleability
- removal of the scripting language
- CoinJoin and normal transactions are indistinguishable
- elimination of edge-cases that prevent independent node implementations
- <=10 second transaction times
- elimination of the need for mining to achieve blockchain consensus

## Changelog

[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## Installation

Skycoin supports go1.10+.

### Go 1.10+ Installation and Setup

[Golang 1.10+ Installation/Setup](./INSTALLATION.md)

### Go get skycoin

```sh
go get github.com/skycoin/skycoin/...
```

This will download `github.com/skycoin/skycoin` to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/skycoin/skycoin`.

You can also clone the repo directly with `git clone https://github.com/skycoin/skycoin`,
but it must be cloned to this path: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/skycoin/skycoin`.

### Run Skycoin from the command line

```sh
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/skycoin/skycoin
make run
```

### Show Skycoin node options

```sh
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/skycoin/skycoin
make run-help
```

### Run Skycoin with options

Example:

```sh
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/skycoin/skycoin
make ARGS="--launch-browser=false -data-dir=/custom/path" run
```

### Docker image

This is the quickest way to start using Skycoin using Docker.

```sh
$ docker volume create skycoin-data
$ docker volume create skycoin-wallet
$ docker run -ti --rm \
    -v skycoin-data:/data/.skycoin \
    -v skycoin-wallet:/wallet \
    -p 6000:6000 \
    -p 6420:6420 \
    skycoin/skycoin
```

This image has a `skycoin` user for the skycoin daemon to run, with UID and GID 10000.
When you mount the volumes, the container will change their owner, so you
must be aware that if you are mounting an existing host folder any content you
have there will be own by 10000.

The container will run with some default options, but you can change them
by just appending flags at the end of the `docker run` command. The following
example will show you the available options.

```sh
docker run --rm skycoin/skycoin -help
```

Access the dashboard: [http://localhost:6420](http://localhost:6420).

Access the API: [http://localhost:6420/version](http://localhost:6420/version).

### Building your own images

[Building your own images](docker/images/mainnet/README.md).

### Development image

The [skycoin/skycoindev-cli docker image](docker/images/dev-cli/README.md) is provided in order to make
easy to start developing Skycoin. It comes with the compiler, linters, debugger
and the vim editor among other tools.

## API Documentation

### REST API

[REST API](src/api/README.md).

### JSON-RPC 2.0 API

*Deprecated, avoid using this*

[JSON-RPC 2.0 README](src/api/webrpc/README.md).

### Skycoin command line interface

[CLI command API](cmd/cli/README.md).

## Integrating Skycoin with your application

[Skycoin Integration Documentation](INTEGRATION.md)

## Contributing a node to the network

Add your node's `ip:port` to the [peers.txt](peers.txt) file.
This file will be periodically uploaded to https://downloads.skycoin.net/blockchain/peers.txt
and used to seed client with peers.

*Note*: Do not add Skywire nodes to `peers.txt`.
Only add Skycoin nodes with high uptime and a static IP address (such as a Skycoin node hosted on a VPS).

## Creating a new coin

See the [newcoin tool README](./cmd/newcoin/README.md)

## URI Specification

Skycoin URIs obey the same rules as specified in Bitcoin's [BIP21](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki).
They use the same fields, except with the addition of an optional `hours` parameter, specifying the coin hours.

Example Skycoin URIs:

* `skycoin:2hYbwYudg34AjkJJCRVRcMeqSWHUixjkfwY`
* `skycoin:2hYbwYudg34AjkJJCRVRcMeqSWHUixjkfwY?amount=123.456&hours=70`
* `skycoin:2hYbwYudg34AjkJJCRVRcMeqSWHUixjkfwY?amount=123.456&hours=70&label=friend&message=Birthday%20Gift`

## Development

We have two branches: `master` and `develop`.

`develop` is the default branch and will have the latest code.

`master` will always be equal to the current stable release on the website, and should correspond with the latest release tag.

### Modules

* `api` - REST API interface
* `api/webrpc` - JSON-RPC 2.0 API [deprecated]
* `cipher` - cryptographic library
* `cli` - CLI library
* `coin` - blockchain data structures
* `daemon` - top-level application manager, combining all components (networking, database, wallets)
* `daemon/gnet` - networking library
* `daemon/pex` - peer management
* `visor` - top-level blockchain database layer
* `visor/blockdb` - low-level blockchain database layer
* `visor/historydb` - low-level blockchain database layer for historical blockchain metadata
* `wallet` - wallet file management

### Client libraries

Skycoin implements client libraries which export core functionality for usage from
other programming languages.

* `lib/cgo/` - libskycoin C client library ( [overview](lib/cgo/README.md), [API reference](docs/libc/API.md) )

For further details run `make docs` to generate documetation and read the corresponding README and API references.

### Running Tests

```sh
make test
```

### Running Integration Tests

There are integration tests for the CLI and HTTP API interfaces. They have two
run modes, "stable" and "live.

The stable integration tests will use a skycoin daemon
whose blockchain is synced to a specific point and has networking disabled so that the internal
state does not change.

The live integration tests should be run against a synced or syncing node with networking enabled.

#### Stable Integration Tests

```sh
make integration-test-stable
```

or

```sh
./ci-scripts/integration-test-stable.sh -v -w
```

The `-w` option, run wallet integrations tests.

The `-v` option, show verbose logs.

#### Live Integration Tests

The live integration tests run against a live runnning skycoin node, so before running the test, we
need to start a skycoin node:

```sh
./run.sh -launch-browser=false
```

After the skycoin node is up, run the following command to start the live tests:

```sh
./ci-scripts/integration-test.live.sh -v
```

The above command will run all tests except the wallet related tests. To run wallet tests, we
need to manually specify a wallet file, and it must have at least `2 coins` and `256 coinhours`,
it also must have been loaded by the node.

We can specify the wallet by setting two environment variables: `WALLET_DIR` and `WALLET_NAME`. The `WALLET_DIR`
represents the absolute path of the wallet directory, and `WALLET_NAME` represents the wallet file name.

Note: `WALLET_DIR` is only used by the CLI integration tests. The GUI integration tests use the node's
configured wallet directory, which can be controlled with `-wallet-dir` when running the node.

If the wallet is encrypted, also set `WALLET_PASSWORD`.

```sh
export WALLET_DIR="$HOME/.skycoin/wallets"
export WALLET_NAME="$valid_wallet_filename"
export WALLET_PASSWORD="$wallet_password"
```

Then run the tests with the following command:

```sh
make integration-test-live
```

or

```sh
./ci-scripts/integration-test-live.sh -v -w
```

#### Debugging Integration Tests

Run specific test case:

It's annoying and a waste of time to run all tests to see if the test we real care
is working correctly. There's an option: `-r`, which can be used to run specific test case.
For exampe: if we only want to test `TestStableAddressBalance` and see the result, we can run:

```sh
./ci-scripts/integration-test-stable.sh -v -r TestStableAddressBalance
```

#### Update golden files in integration testdata

Golden files are expected data responses from the CLI or HTTP API saved to disk.
When the tests are run, their output is compared to the golden files.

To update golden files, use the `-u` option:

```sh
./ci-scripts/integration-test-live.sh -v -u
./ci-scripts/integration-test-stable.sh -v -u
```

We can also update a specific test case's golden file with the `-r` option.

### Test coverage

Coverage is automatically generated for `make test` and integration tests run against a stable node.
This includes integration test coverage. The coverage output files are placed in `coverage/`.

To merge coverage from all tests into a single HTML file for viewing:

```sh
make check
make merge-coverage
```

Then open `coverage/all-coverage.html` in the browser.

#### Test coverage for the live node

Some tests can only be run with a live node, for example wallet spending tests.
To generate coverage for this, build and run the skycoin node in test mode before running the live integration tests.

In one shell:

```sh
make run-integration-test-live-cover
```

In another shell:

```sh
make integration-test-live
```

After the tests have run, CTRL-C to exit the process from the first shell.
A coverage file will be generated at `coverage/skycoin-live.coverage.out`.

Merge the coverage with `make merge-coverage` then open the `coverage/all-coverage.html` file to view it,
or generate the HTML coverage in isolation with `go tool cover -html`

### Formatting

All `.go` source files should be formatted `goimports`.  You can do this with:

```sh
make format
```

### Code Linting

Install prerequisites:

```sh
make install-linters
```

Run linters:

```sh
make lint
```

### Profiling

A full CPU profile of the program from start to finish can be obtained by running the node with the `-profile-cpu` flag.
Once the node terminates, a profile file is written to `-profile-cpu-file` (defaults to `cpu.prof`).
This profile can be analyzed with

```sh
go tool pprof cpu.prof
```

The HTTP interface for obtaining more profiling data or obtaining data while running can be enabled with `-http-prof`.
The HTTP profiling interface can be controlling with `-http-prof-host` and listens on `localhost:6060` by default.

See https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/ for guidance on using the HTTP profiler.

Some useful examples include:

```sh
go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=10
go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap
```

A web page interface is provided by http/pprof at http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/.

### Dependencies

#### Rules

Dependencies must not require `cgo`.  This means dependencies cannot be wrappers around C libraries.
Requiring `cgo` breaks cross compilation and interferes with repeatable (deterministic) builds.

Critical cryptographic dependencies used by code in package `cipher` are archived inside the `cipher` folder,
rather than in the `vendor` folder.  This prevents a user of the `cipher` package from accidentally using a
different version of the `cipher` dependencies than were developed, which could have catastrophic but hidden problems.

#### Management

Dependencies are managed with [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep).

To [install `dep` for development](https://github.com/golang/dep/blob/master/docs/installation.md#development):

```sh
go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
```

`dep` vendors all dependencies into the repo.

If you change the dependencies, you should update them as needed with `dep ensure`.

Use `dep help` for instructions on vendoring a specific version of a dependency, or updating them.

When updating or initializing, `dep` will find the latest version of a dependency that will compile.

Examples:

Initialize all dependencies:

```sh
dep init
```

Update all dependencies:

```sh
dep ensure -update -v
```

Add a single dependency (latest version):

```sh
dep ensure github.com/foo/bar
```

Add a single dependency (more specific version), or downgrade an existing dependency:

```sh
dep ensure github.com/foo/bar@tag
```

### Configuration Modes
There are 4 configuration modes in which you can run a skycoin node:
- Development Desktop Daemon
- Server Daemon
- Electron Desktop Client
- Standalone Desktop Client

#### Development Desktop Daemon Mode
This mode is configured via `run.sh`
```bash
$ ./run.sh
```

#### Server Daemon Mode
The default settings for a skycoin node are chosen for `Server Daemon`, which is typically run from source.
This mode is usually preferred to be run with security options, though `-disable-csrf` is normal for server daemon mode, it is left enabled by default.
```bash
$ go run cmd/skycoin/skycoin.go
```

#### Electron Desktop Client Mode
This mode configures itself via electron-main.js

#### Standalone Desktop Client Mode
This mode is configured by compiling with `STANDALONE_CLIENT` build tag.
The configuration is handled in `cmd/skycoin/skycoin.go`

### Wallet GUI Development

The compiled wallet source should be checked in to the repo, so that others do not need to install node to run the software.

Instructions for doing this:

[Wallet GUI Development README](src/gui/static/README.md)

### Releases

0. If the `master` branch has commits that are not in `develop` (e.g. due to a hotfix applied to `master`), merge `master` into `develop`
1. Compile the `src/gui/static/dist/` to make sure that it is up to date (see [Wallet GUI Development README](src/gui/static/README.md))
2. Update all version strings in the repo (grep for them) to the new version
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md`: move the "unreleased" changes to the version and add the date
4. Update files in `docker/images/mainnet/repo-info/remote/`, adding a new file for the new version and adjusting any configuration text that may have changed
5. Merge these changes to `develop`
6. Follow the steps in [pre-release testing](#pre-release-testing)
7. Make a PR merging `develop` into `master`
8. Review the PR and merge it
9. Tag the master branch with the version number. Version tags start with `v`, e.g. `v0.20.0`.
    Sign the tag. If you have your GPG key in github, creating a release on the Github website will automatically tag the release.
    It can be tagged from the command line with `git tag -as v0.20.0 $COMMIT_ID`, but Github will not recognize it as a "release".
10. Make sure that the client runs properly from the `master` branch
11. Release builds are created and uploaded by travis. To do it manually, checkout the `master` branch and follow the [create release builds](electron/README.md) instructions.

If there are problems discovered after merging to master, start over, and increment the 3rd version number.
For example, `v0.20.0` becomes `v0.20.1`, for minor fixes.

#### Pre-release testing

Performs these actions before releasing:

* `make check`
* `make integration-test-live` (see [live integration tests](#live-integration-tests)) both with an unencrypted and encrypted wallet.
* `go run cmd/cli/cli.go checkdb` against a synced node
* On all OSes, make sure that the client runs properly from the command line (`./run.sh`)
* Build the releases and make sure that the Electron client runs properly on Windows, Linux and macOS.
    * Use a clean data directory with no wallets or database to sync from scratch and verify the wallet setup wizard.
    * Load a test wallet with nonzero balance from seed to confirm wallet loading works
    * Send coins to another wallet to confirm spending works
    * Restart the client, confirm that it reloads properly
