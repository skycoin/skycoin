verify.go: Methods for handling transaction verification

There are two levels of transaction constraint: HARD and SOFT
There are two situations in which transactions are verified:
    * When included in a block
    * When not in a block

For transactions in a block, use VerifyBlockTxnConstraints.
For transactions outside of a block, use VerifySingleTxnHardConstraints and VerifySingleTxnSoftConstraints.

VerifyBlockTxnConstraints only checks hard constraints. Soft constraints do not apply for transactions inside of a block.

Soft and hard constraints have special handling for single transactions.

When the transaction is received over the network, a transaction is not injected to the pool if it violates the HARD constraints.
If it violates soft constraints, it is still injected to the pool (TODO: with expiration) but is not rebroadcast to peers.
If it does not violate any constraints it is injected and rebroadcast to peers.

When the transaction is created by the user (with create_rawtx or /spend), SOFT and HARD constraints apply, to prevent
the user from injecting a transaction to their local pool that cannot be confirmed.

When creating a new block from transactions, SOFT and HARD constraints apply.

Transactions in the unconfirmed pool are periodically checked for validity. (TODO: audit/implement this feature)
The transaction pool state transfer phases are as follows:
    valid -> hard_invalid: remove
    valid -> soft_invalid: mark as invalid
    soft_invalid -> valid: mark as valid, broadcast
    soft_invalid -> hard_invalid: remove
    soft_invalid -> expired: remove

HARD constraints can NEVER be violated. These include:
    - Malformed transaction
    - Double spends
    - NOTE: Double spend verification must be done against the unspent output set,
            the methods here do not operate on the unspent output set.
            They accept a `uxIn coin.UxArray` argument, which are the unspents associated
            with the transaction's inputs.  The unspents must be queried from the unspent
            output set first, thus if any unspent is not found for the input, it cannot be spent.

SOFT constraints are based upon mutable parameters. These include:
    - Max block size (transaction must not be larger than this value)
    - Insufficient coin hour burn fee
    - Timelocked distribution addresses
    - Decimal place restrictions

NOTE: Due to a bug which allowed overflowing output coin hours to be included in a block,
      overflowing output coin hours are not checked when adding a signed block, so that the existing blocks can be processed.
      When creating or receiving a single transaction from the network, it is treated as a HARD constraint.

These methods should be called via the Blockchain object when possible,
using Blockchain.VerifyBlockTxnConstraints, Blockchain.VerifySingleTxnHardConstraints and Blockchain.VerifySingleTxnAllConstraints
since data from the blockchain and unspent output set are required to fully validate a transaction.
