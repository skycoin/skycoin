  * *Part of the [upgrade/static](/docs/ts/latest/api/#!?query=upgrade%2Fstatic)
  * library for hybrid upgrade apps that support AoT compilation*
  * *
  * Allow an Angular 2+ service to be accessible from Angular 1.
  * *
  * *
  * First ensure that the service to be downgraded is provided in an {@link NgModule}
  * that will be part of the upgrade application. For example, let's assume we have
  * defined `HeroesService`
  * *
  * {@example upgrade/static/ts/module.ts region="ng2-heroes-service"}
  * *
  * and that we have included this in our upgrade app {@link NgModule}
  * *
  * {@example upgrade/static/ts/module.ts region="ng2-module"}
  * *
  * Now we can register the `downgradeInjectable` factory function for the service
  * on an Angular 1 module.
  * *
  * {@example upgrade/static/ts/module.ts region="downgrade-ng2-heroes-service"}
  * *
  * Inside an Angular 1 component's controller we can get hold of the
  * downgraded service via the name we gave when downgrading.
  * *
  * {@example upgrade/static/ts/module.ts region="example-app"}
  * *
  * *
  * Takes a `token` that identifies a service provided from Angular 2+.
  * *
  * Returns a [factory function](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di) that can be
  * used to register the service on an Angular 1 module.
  * *
  * The factory function provides access to the Angular 2+ service that
  * is identified by the `token` parameter.
  * *
 * @param {?} token
 * @return {?}
